----------------------------------------------------
Assignment 5 
This Section mainly focuses on the various Data Structures in Python such as Dictionaries , List, Tuple ,Strings, Sets 
Lists
A list is an ordered, mutable collection that can hold items of mixed data types.
Tuples
A tuple is an ordered, immutable collection used to group related data.
Strings
A string represents a sequence of characters and is immutable in Python.
Sets
A set is an unordered collection of unique, immutable elements
In the given assignment they asked to use this data structures to resolve the problem statement 


Task #1

This code defines a dictionary with student names as keys and their marks as values.  
The code  checks if the entered name exists in the dictionary using the `in` operator. If the name is found, it prints the marks of the student using an f-
string for formatting. If the name does not exist, it prints an error message ("Student not foound"). The code demonstrates how to use dictionaries for data 
storage, retrieve values and use conditional statements in Python.

Task #2 

This code creates a list called numbers containing integers from 1 to 10 using range(1, 11) wrapped in list(). It then extracts the first five elements of this 
list with slicing (numbers[:5]) and stores them in Extracted_list. Next, it reverses Extracted_list using slicing with a step of -1 ([::-1]) and stores the result 
in reversed_first_five. Finally, the code prints the original list, the first five extracted elements, and the reversed extracted list. This demonstrates list 
creation, slicing to extract sublists, and slicing to reverse a list in Python.
